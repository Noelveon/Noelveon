## Welcome to Noelveon's profile!
I'm Noelia, a.k.a Noelveon, an high school student who likes programming, more specifically videogames!
I have some experience programming in C# with Unity and actually I'm learning Python.
I'm looking to study a programming degree and work doing backend, and my goal is work for a videogames company.
